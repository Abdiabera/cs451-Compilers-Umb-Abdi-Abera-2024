Text-Based Adventure Game
Next, let’s create a simple text-based adventure game.

There is no real goal of this game, except that you will enable the user to explore a world of your own making.  Users will explore your world by entering:  east, west, north, south, up and down.  Users can also type ‘look’ to see a description of their current location and type ‘quit’ to end the game.

To receive full credit:

You must create at least 6 locations in your world.  Please be creative!
You must break your program into functions, and include comments.

Hint:  Connecting the locations via some kind of internal map is the tricky part of this program.  Consider what data structures might be best for this.

Below is a sample run from my world.  User input is denoted in bold.

You are standing in a large garden.
You can see beautiful flowers all around.
There is a small house to the east.
> east
You are standing in a kitchen.
It's a mess in here!
You can see a garden to the west, and a small bedroom to the east.
> west
You are in the Garden.
> look
You are standing in a large garden.
You can see beautiful flowers all around.
There is a small house to the east.
You are in the Garden.
> east
You are in the Kitchen.
> look
You are standing in a kitchen.
It's a mess in here!
You can see a garden to the west, and a small bedroom to the east.
You are in the Kitchen.
> east
You are standing in a small bedroom.
There is a small hole in the ground and,
it looks like you can climb down.
You can also see a kitchen to the west.
> down
You are standing in a room that looks like a hidden, nuclear bunker.
There are metal canisters along the wall.
There is a ladder going up.
It's a bit dark, but you can also see a panel of buttons to the left.
> quit
Thanks for playing!
